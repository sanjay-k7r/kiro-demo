# When Vibe Coding Goes Wrong

This is a simple task tracker that went hilariously wrong—then got fixed the right way. Built to demonstrate how Kiro catches requirements issues before they become production nightmares.

npm install
npm run dev
npm test
```


## Why Kiro?

Vibe coding is fun until it ships. Kiro keeps the fun while fixing the chaos through three key capabilities:

### Specs
Transform natural language prompts into structured artifacts—requirements, design documents, and sequenced tasks. Specs make your intent explicit so agents can fix bugs in minutes, iterate on features faster, and solve tough problems across complex codebases.

### Hooks
Automate agent actions based on IDE events. Trigger linting on save, run tests when files change, or kick off custom workflows. Hooks let you build guardrails that keep quality high without manual intervention.

### Steering
Define standards and context that guide every interaction. Team conventions, project-specific instructions, and useful context live in steering files—so the agent always knows how your team works.
