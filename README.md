# Mischievous Todo App

A todo app where the Done button doesn't want to be clicked.

The button runs away, demands multiple clicks, and asks if you're *really* sure. It's what happens when you vibe code "make it more fun" without specs.

Built to demo [Kiro](https://kiro.dev)'s spec-driven development: requirements → design → tasks. Structure without losing the vibes.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm test
```


## Why Specs?

Most tools are great at generating code, but Kiro gives structure to the chaos before you write a single line. Vibe coding is fast and fun for prototypes, but it can misinterpret context and require constant guidance on complex tasks. Specs make your intent explicit.

Kiro transforms natural language prompts into structured artifacts: requirements, design documents, and sequenced tasks. This isn't about slowing down—it's about building precise context so agents can fix bugs in minutes, iterate on features faster, and solve tough problems across complex codebases.
